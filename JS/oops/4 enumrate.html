    <h3>
        In JavaScript, the for...in loop is often used for enumerating over the properties of an object. However, <br>it's important to note that for...in iterates over all enumerable properties, including inherited ones, and it's not guaranteed to iterate in a specific order. Also,<br> it may not behave as expected when used with arrays.
    </h3>

<br>
<script>
    const car = {
        name : 'Toyta' , 
        model: 'Camry',
        year: 2022
    };

    for (let key in car){
        console.log(`keys ::  ${key} and values  ${car[key]}`);
    }
</script>

<h3>
    For iterating over elements in an array, it's recommended to use the for...of loop:  
    </h3>

    <script>
        const arr = [1 ,2 ,3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8];
        for (let n in arr){
            console.log(`index is ${n} and elements ${arr[n]}`);
        }


    </script>


<h3>
    if you want to enumerate over the indices of an array along with the values,<br> you can still use for...in: 
    </h3>

    <script>
        const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

        for (let number of numbers) {
        console.log(number);
        }

    </script>

    <h3>
        It's worth mentioning that starting from ECMAScript 2015 (ES6),<br> you can also use Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() for more explicit iteration over the properties of an object <br> or elements of an array. These methods provide arrays that you can iterate using standard loops or the forEach method.
