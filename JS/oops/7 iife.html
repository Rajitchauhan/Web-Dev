    <h3>
        IIFE stands for Immediately Invoked Function Expression. <br>
        It is a common JavaScript pattern where a function is defined and executed immediately <br>
         after its creation. IIFE is often used to create a private scope for variables to avoid polluting <br>
           the global scope and to provide encapsulation.
    </h3>

    <script>
        (function() {
        // This code is inside the IIFE and has its own scope
        let variableInsideIIFE = "I am inside the IIFE!";
        console.log(variableInsideIIFE);
        })();
        // variableInsideIIFE is not accessible outside the IIFE 
            //and will throw an error if you try to access it here
