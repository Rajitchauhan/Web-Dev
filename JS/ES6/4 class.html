   <h3>
    In JavaScript, the class keyword is used to define a class, <br>
    <br>
     which is a blueprint for creating objects. <br>
      Classes provide a way to create and organize objects with shared properties and methods.
      <br>
       Class-based syntax was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and has since become a standard part <br>
        of modern JavaScript.

        class Person{
            constructor(name , age){
                this.name = name;
                this.age = age;
            }
            showName(){
                console.log(`name is :: ${this.name} and his age is ${this.age}`);
            }
        }
